# Assumptions

During this exercise, I have made some assumptions regarding the task.

The first assumption is that during my refactor I am NOT to make functional changes, such as using '.Contains' to match all items with 'Brie' or 'Sulfuras'.
This assumption is made so that the functionality of the legacy code, is not changed at all.
I am acting as if I am not aware of other business logic the legacy code is doing, therefore changing any functionality may reciprocate to potential unintended side effects.

To combat this, during the refactor I am attempting to write the business logic in a way where the conditions match and are easily refactorable to change the business logic.

I'm mainly noting this so that you as the reviewer are aware of my reason for doing this, and as a reviewer can provide the feedback
which allows me to iterate on this process and achieve the desired input (feedback loop).

Upon adding the 'Conjured' business logic, the golden master tests fail, since the values now do not match. I believe this is as expected.

As in this instance our feedback loop is a single iteration, I am focusing on highlighting my assumptions and choices so they can be easily identified and feedback can be given
